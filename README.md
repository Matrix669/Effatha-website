### Description

A website for the Effatha community in Gliwice. For now, it is under construction, so some things are still missing. Later, it will be converted into a Wordpress template using PHP functions.

### I have learned:

- How to properly add wrappers. This means that if a section has a background assigned, it doesn't interfere with the wrapper. It spans the full width, and then - there's the content.
- How to add cosmetic elements in the background: gradient.
- To manage Gulp (Kit) even better.
- To create reusable components in SCSS, like the nav or footer.
- How to properly break down the SCSS file into components.
- How to use Git:
- git add/commit
- git push -u origin master
- How to add a repository via SSH.

### Problem:

- Importing local fonts - sorted out âœ”
- There were issues with positioning these cosmetic divs (gradients). It required some work to correctly place them, and set their width and height.

### Todo:

| | - Secure text for your own theme from WordPress.

| | - Transform the entire structure of the website into your own WordPress theme.

| | - Create animations when the page loads
